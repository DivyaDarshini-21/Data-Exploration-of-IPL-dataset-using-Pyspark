# Data-Exploration-of-IPL-dataset-using-Pyspark

In this project, we are going to analyse several different insights about IPL matches played between 2008-2020 using PySpark and SparkSQL.
As this is a  really large dataset, Spark is really great choice because of its power for handling bigdata.
Due to parallel execution on all cores on multiple machines...........PySpark runs operations faster than Pandas, hence we often required to covert Pandas DataFrame to PySpark (Spark with Python) for better performance
